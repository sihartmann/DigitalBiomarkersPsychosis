One of the things I've watched while I've been stuck in my room is there's a series.
It's on I view called capture and it's about deep fakes.
It's series two that's up there now.
And it's about political entities being able to just erase events by editing CCTV.
And it's really quite good.
It's not good for you.
It's a paranoia, but it's good.
It's a good British crime.
It's been a drama. It's good. It's worth watching.
Yeah.
I'm like, no, there's you don't know anymore.
What you can't believe when you simply.
Yeah, yeah, all that stuff.
It's it's very well done, then it's.
Yeah, it's worth watching.
I won't say anymore.
But I'm glad that you.
I don't know who you are.
That's all right.
I don't know.
I've claimed COVID like memory loss.
I don't know if that's one of the side effects.
It could be.
I think it's actually.
I haven't.
