4 score and 7 years ago, our fathers brought forth upon this continent a new nation, conceived
in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived
and so dedicated can long endure.
We are met on a great battlefield of that war.
We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who
here gave their lives that that nation might live.
It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this, but in a larger sense, we
cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground.
The brave men, living and dead who struggled here, have consecrated, far above our poor
power toatter-detract.
The world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget
what they did here.
It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who
fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.
It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us.
That from these honored dead, we take increased devotion to the cause for which they gave the
last full measure of devotion.
That we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain.
This nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people
by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth.
Abraham Lincoln, November 19, 1863.
